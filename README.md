# CourseSchedulePlanner

Using a database of courses, the program uses DFS and BFS to determine things such as
1) The next courses someone is eligible to take
2) The courses one needs to take to reach a target course
3) If a class is a valid prerequisite for another class
4) Can provide a personalized schedule plan to reach a target course
